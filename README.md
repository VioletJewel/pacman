pacman

Pacman in java. Pacman, the ghosts, everything was made by drawing rectangles not using images.

This was a project for Intro to Computer science (junior year). It is not complete. Although
wall detection works and pacman and the ghosts move around, the walls are not configured
properly and there is a problem with ghost movement and they don't start as they should.
This also does not implement the patterns that the ghosts follow in the original Pacman
game.

Perhaps I'll finish it up soon.
